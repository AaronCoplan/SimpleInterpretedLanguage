Compile: `javac src/main/java/com/aaroncoplan/**/*.java`

Run: `java -cp ./src/main/java com.aaroncoplan.Application <filepath> <phasenumber (optional)>`

### Phase 1

Basic interpreter with 3 built in functions - add, multiply, and print.  Limited error checking.  
Note there is no concept of strings or doubles, only integers and functions.
Splits each line using spaces as the delimiter and pushes each item to the stack unless it is a function name.
For example, `3 4 add print` would push 3 to the stack, push 4 to the stack, recognize `add` as a function and execute it
(which would pop 3, pop 4, add them, then push the result to the stack), then recognize `print` as a function and execute it
(which would pop 7 from the stack and print it).
